              necessary for the fulfillment of our contractual and legal
              obligations or otherwise for the purposes pursued with the
              processing, i.e. for the duration of the entire business
              relationship (from the initiation, processing to the termination
              of a contract) and beyond that in accordance with the statutory
              retention and documentation obligations. We retain personal data
              for the period in which claims can be asserted against our company
              (during the statutory limitation period) and insofar as we are
              otherwise legally obliged to do so or legitimate business
              interests require this (e.g. for evidence and documentation
              purposes). As soon as your personal data is no longer required for
              the above-mentioned purposes, it will be deleted or anonymized as
              far as possible.
