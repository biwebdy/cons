            <h3 style={{ paddingTop: "15px" }}>5. User responsibility</h3>
            <p style={{ margin: "0px" }}>
              As a user, you are solely responsible for your technical access to
              the platform. The provider is neither responsible for the internet
              provider nor for the hardware and software required to use the
              platform.
            </p>
            <p style={{ margin: "0px" }}>
              The provider takes technical and organisational measures to secure
              the data that it makes available to you. Nevertheless, inadequate
              security measures on your end device may result in unauthorised
              access to your data. It cannot be ruled out that a third party may
              access your end device unnoticed while you are connected to the
              platform. The provider therefore recommends that you equip your
              end devices with up-to-date protection programmes and protect them
              with a password when using a WLAN. The end device (computer,
              telephone, smartphone, etc.) and/or the network used are outside
              the provider&apos;s control and may represent a weak point. As a
              user, you accept the associated risks. You are responsible for
              informing yourself about the necessary security equipment in
              accordance with the current state of the art and for taking
              appropriate protective measures.
            </p>
            <p style={{ margin: "0px" }}>
              The user name, password and access code for connecting to the
              platform must be kept secret and protected against misuse by
              unauthorised third parties. Although the Provider shall take the
              necessary organisational and technical measures within the
              framework of the statutory provisions to protect your data from
              unauthorised processing, you shall be responsible for the
              consequences arising from the misuse of your identification keys
              by unauthorised persons, subject to gross negligence on the part
              of the Provider. If there is a suspicion that unauthorised third
              parties have gained knowledge of the identification keys, you must
              change them immediately. If you download documents from the
              provider&apos;s platform to your own end device, you are
              responsible for the security of the data contained therein. The
              Provider declines all responsibility as soon as a document has
              left the IT system of the Provider or one of its service
              providers.

              Furthermore, no guarantee is given that submitted application

            <p style={{ margin: "0px" }}>
              Subject to mandatory law, the Provider excludes all liability,
              including that of its officers, employees, suppliers and auxiliary
              staff, for your loss or damage of any kind in connection with
              access to the Provider&apos;s platform and the use of its content.

              Switzerland or in the European Union and process your personal
              data there. If necessary, the provider may also transfer your
              personal data to third-party service providers based abroad in
              countries for which an adequacy decision exists or to third
              parties whose level of protection is not equivalent to that in
              Switzerland. In such a case, you expressly authorise the provider
              to transfer your personal data to these service providers. The
